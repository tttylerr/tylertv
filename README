# Tyler TV
What is Tyler TV? 

Tyler TV is a upcoming Streaming Service by Tyler Nodes. Tyler Nodes is managed by Tyler. He is the only person there. Sometimes friends will help out and I will ask things on stack exchange. 

## How does it work?

It works by me making ui look nice and using browser-built-in video players. I also have to get all the movies and shows which is not fun to obtain licenses for (copyright sucks). 

## How do you run this?

I plan on releaseing a paid service for this for 1 reason: ***Hosting Costs***. Hosting is not free. Even if I hosted locally, the power in my area of Michigan is very expensive and I, although its very powerful, do not have a computer powerful enough to handle 100+ users streaming video. 

## What does the local server run?

I am running *Windows 11* with the following specs:

 - **GTX 1080 Custom Built and Water Cooled**
 - **Intel Core i7-9700F with speeds of 4.60 ghz on average**
 - **2 SSDs resulting in 1.5tb of storage**
 - **Turtle Wifi**
 - **16GB of memory**

## When is release?
I am aiming for July of 2024, but it will probably be pushed back. I expect to start Beta testing is early to mid 2023 and possibly late 2022.
